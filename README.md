# Canny Edge Detection with TensorFlow

Canny Edge Detection is a widely used image processing technique for identifying edges within images. 
This project provides an implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. 
With this implementation, you can quickly and easily apply edge detection to your images.
